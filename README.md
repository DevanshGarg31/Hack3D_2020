# CSAW Hack3D 2020

> The Hack3D competition serves to raise awareness and generate discussion in engineering and research communities about security in the additive manufacturing field. In Hack3Dâ€™s 2019 Qualifying Round, participants were challenged to reconstruct a corrupted .gcode file, employing skills in graphics programming, file manipulation, and reverse-engineering. In the Final Round, teams competed in hacking an anti-counterfeiting system designed to protect CAD models.

The Hack3D competition is organized by Professor Nikhil Gupta, post-doctoral researcher Hammond Pearce, and student researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. 

This repo is a documentation of the Hack3D 2020 challenge of DC-War-Story from **MNIT Jaipur** who secured the 2nd place.
